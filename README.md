# ASbot - RAG Chatbot & Complaint-Suggestion System 

ðŸ¤© As part of the first Hackathon of the Hack Series sponsored by Anadolu Sigorta, we developed a chatbot that can answer users' questions quickly and effectively. This chatbot is designed to help users learn about various topics related to Anadolu Sigorta products. In addition, to further enrich the user experience, we integrated a complaint and suggestion system that can be accessed from both the application menu and the chatbot interface. This system allows users to provide direct feedback when they have any problems or suggestions. The aim of our project is to respond quickly and efficiently to users' needs and provide them with comprehensive support.

## ASbot - RAG Chatbot & Complaint-Suggestion System GenAI Features

**ChatOpenAI**: The ChatOpenAI class is used to create a chat assistant using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

**OpenAIEmbeddings**: OpenAIEmbeddings is used to turn texts into embedded vectors (embeddings). This enables semantic analysis and comparison of texts.

**TextLoader**: `TextLoader` is used to load texts from a specific file. This provides the source texts on which the chat assistant will be based.

**RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**: This tool breaks large texts into smaller pieces. This makes large texts easier to process and increases efficiency.

**VectorStore**: `ChromaDB` organizes text fragments into vectors and stores them in a repository. This enables fast and efficient text searches.

**RetrievalQA**: `RetrievalQA` retrieves the most relevant information from the identified texts to answer users' questions.

**query**: This function processes the questions received from the user and generates appropriate responses. PromptTemplate and RetrievalQA are used in this process.

**Template**: This is a format template that makes the Q&A system work by bringing together the user's questions and the underlying texts.
